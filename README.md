# Metrics-project
## Analysis of mobile app subscriptions and revenue
### ðŸ“Œ Project description  
In this project, I analyzed the subscription model of a mobile application using SQL to process data and Tableau to visualize key metrics. The main goal is to evaluate the factors that influence the change in revenue, number of subscribers, and average check. And also to have ready-made solutions for analyzing other metrics
### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives of the analysis  
- Identify the main drivers of changes in revenue (Revenue).  
- Investigate the factors of user churn (Churn).  
- Evaluate the impact of new subscribers and recurring payments on MRR.  
- Calculate LTV and ARPPU for different user groups.  
- Build an interactive dashboard in Tableau to visualize trends.
### ðŸ”§ Tools and technologies  
- SQL (PostgreSQL, DBeaver) - for data processing and calculation of key metrics.  
- Tableau - to create a dashboard with key indicators and calculate metrics
### ðŸ“Š Key metrics and additional metrics that are calculated
- MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) - monthly revenue from subscriptions.  
- ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User) is the average revenue per paying user.  
- LTV (Lifetime Value) is the expected revenue per user for the entire period of time.  
- Churn Rate - the level of user churn.  
- Expansion Revenue is the increase in revenue from existing users.  
- New Paid Users - the number of new users who have signed up for a subscription.
- Paid Users - the number of paying users.
- New MRR is the MRR generated by users who became paying in the corresponding month.
- Churned Users - is the number of users who stopped paying in the corresponding period.
- Churned revenue - total revenue for the previous period from all users who stopped paying.
- Revenue Churn rate is the ratio of the previous month's revenue from those users who did not continue to pay to the revenue for a certain calendar month.
- MRR Contraction - the amount by which the MRR has decreased from one month to the next.
- Customer LifeTime (LT) is the average amount of time from the first payment to the user's dropout.
### ðŸ“Œ Main results  
- It was determined that repeat payments and user returns have the greatest impact on revenue changes.  
- The outflow factors were analyzed and the months with the largest drop in the number of paid users were identified.  
- A dashboard was built to track changes in revenue, average check, number of new subscribers, and churn rates.
